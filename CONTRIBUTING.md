How to Contribute
=================

This is a repository for Python 101 (SJTU) assignment.

Pull Requests
-------------

1. Pull requests are welcome. If you would like to add a large feature
   or make a significant change, make sure to open an issue to discuss with
   people first.
2. Follow PEP8.
3. Make sure to pass the unit tests. Write unit tests for new modules if
   needed.

Issues
------

1. Only bugs and feature requests are accepted here.
2. Shall only work on important features. If the feature you're asking only
   benefits a few people, you'd better implement the feature yourself and send us a pull request, or ask some of your friends to do so.
3. Don't answer questions of any other types here, but tips and some troubleshooting on Python can be found here.
4. Issues in languages other than English and Chinese will be Google translated into English later.
