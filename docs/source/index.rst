PyPCAPKit - Comprehensive Network Packet Analysis Library
=========================================================

The PyPCAPKit project is an open source Python program focus on network packet
parsing and analysis, which works as a comprehensive `PCAP`_ file extraction,
construction and analysis library.

.. important::

   The whole project supports **Python 3.6** or later.

About
=====

:mod:`PyPCAPKit <pcapkit>` is an independent open source library, with
:mod:`DictDumper <dictdumper>` as its formatted output dumper.

.. note::

   There is a project called |jspcapy|_ works on :mod:`pcapkit`, which is a
   command line tool for PCAP extraction.

   .. |jspcapy| replace:: ``jspcapy``
   .. _jspcapy: https://github.com/JarryShaw/jspcapy

   .. deprecated:: 0.8.0

      The |jspcapy|_ project is deprecated and has been merged into the
      :mod:`PyPCAPKit <pcapkit>` project as its CLI support.

Unlike popular PCAP file extractors, such as :mod:`Scapy <scapy>`,
:mod:`dpkt <dpkt>`, :mod:`PyShark <pyshark>`, and etc, :mod:`pcapkit` is
designed to be much more comprehensive, which means it is able to provide
more detailed information about the packet, as well as a more *Pythonic*
interface for users to interact with.

----------------
Module Structure
----------------

In :mod:`pcapkit`, all files can be described as following eight parts.

- Interface (:mod:`pcapkit.interface`)

  User interface for the :mod:`pcapkit` library, which
  standardises and simplifies the usage of this library.

- Foundation (:mod:`pcapkit.foundation`)

  Synthesises file I/O and protocol analysis, coordinates
  information exchange in all network layers, as well as
  provides the foundamental functions for :mod:`pcapkit`.

- Protocols (:mod:`pcapkit.protocols`)

  Collection of all protocol family, with detailed
  implementation and methods.

- Utilities (:mod:`pcapkit.utilities`)

  Auxiliary functions and tools for :mod:`pcapkit`.

- CoreKit (:mod:`pcapkit.corekit`)

  Core utilities for :mod:`pcapkit` implementation, mainly
  for internal data structure and processing.

- ToolKit (:mod:`pcapkit.toolkit`)

  Auxiliary tools for :mod:`pcapkit` to support the multiple
  extraction engines with a unified interface.

- DumpKit (:mod:`pcapkit.dumpkit`)

  File output formatters for :mod:`pcapkit`.

- Constants (:mod:`pcapkit.const`)

  Constant enumerations used in :mod:`pcapkit` for protocol
  family extraction and representation.

-----------------
Engine Comparison
-----------------

Due to the general overhead of :mod:`pcapkit`, its extraction procedure takes
around *0.2* milliseconds per packet, which is already impressive but not enough
comparing to other popular extration engines availbale on the market, given the
fact that :mod:`pcapkit` is a **comprehensive** packet processing module.

Additionally, :mod:`pcapkit` introduced alternative extractionengines to accelerate
this procedure. By now :mod:`pcapkit` supports `Scapy`_, `DPKT`_, and `PyShark`_.

Installation
============

.. note::

   :mod:`pcapkit` supports Python versions **since 3.6**.

Simply run the following to install the current version from PyPI:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install pypcapkit

Or install the latest version from the gi repository:

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/JarryShaw/PyPCAPKit.git
   cd pypcapkit
   pip install -e .
   # and to update at any time
   git pull

And since :mod:`pcapkit` supports various extraction engines, and extensive
plug-in functions, you may want to install the optional ones:

.. code-block:: shell

   # for DPKT only
   pip install pypcapkit[DPKT]
   # for Scapy only
   pip install pypcapkit[Scapy]
   # for PyShark only
   pip install pypcapkit[PyShark]
   # and to install all the optional packages
   pip install pypcapkit[all]
   # or to do this explicitly
   pip install pypcapkit dpkt scapy pyshark

For CLI usage, you will need to install the optional packages:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install pypcapkit[cli]
   # or explicitly...
   pip install pypcapkit emoji
